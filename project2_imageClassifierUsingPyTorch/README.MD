## Project 2:  Developing an AI application : Image classification
--------------------------------------------------------------

- Going forward, AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, one might want to include an image classifier in a smartphone app. To do this, we would use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.

- In this project, I  trained  an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We will be building  a deep learning neural network using PyTorch to identify 102 different species of flowers. We will be load a pretrained model and use  transfer learning techniques for this project 

- This project requires Python 3.x and needas a GPU environment, running on CPU is hopeless

- Analysis incudes
  * Loading and dataset using PyTorch
  * Use one of the pretrained models from torchvision.models, build and train the classifier via transfer learning
  * Inference for classification
  * Class Prediction using the developed model





  * preprocessing of the data.
  * handling of missing data.
  * feature selection and re-encoding.
  * engineering of mixed type features.
  * feature transormation.
  * Dimensionality Reduction via PCA.
  * KMeans clustering.
  * Comparison of customer data to demographics data.
