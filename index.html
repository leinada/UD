<ul>
<li>Applied supervised learning techniques  to accurately model individual's income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results was further optimized to get the best model for  the data. Goal was to  construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per annum.

<ul>
<li>Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

<ul>
<li>In this project, I analyzed the 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey data to understand more about data science field. This project was intended to help individuals considering new career as data scientists; to help them make informed decisions about their career choice. We would try to answer three real world questions using the CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining).

<h2 id="31">31</h2>

<p>32
This project creates an ETL and machine learning pipeline to categorize real messages that were sent during disaster events. The aim is to send the  message  directly to the appropriate aid agencies after the categorization. This project includes development of a  web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories which was built using a machine learning model.

<h2 id="37">37</h2>

<p>38
Recommendation engines are one of the most important data science applications. Data science is being used to recommend things such asmusic, movies , books, new destinations etc. In this project, I analysed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. This project will serve as a prototype of the recommender systems of the article recommendation systems of IBM

<h2 id="43">43</h2>

<p>44
Sparkify is a music app, this data set contains two months of sparkify user behavior log.  The goal of the project is to predict churned users based on user activities and attributes. Being able to predict churn can help the  company to prioritize their retention program on customers who are most likely to churn, and potentially save millions in revenue.
