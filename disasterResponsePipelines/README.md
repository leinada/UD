## Project Motivation<a name="project_motivationn"></a>

This project creates an ETL and machine learning pipeline to categorize real messages that were sent during disaster events. The aim is to send the  message  directly to the appropriate aid agencies after the categorization. This project includes development of a  web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories which was built using a machine learning model. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.
