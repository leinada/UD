# Udacity related projects
##### Details of Udacity the two semester datascience nanodegree program is available [here]( https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)




## Project 1: Finding Donors for CharityML
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Applied supervised learning techniques  to accurately model individual's income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results is further optimized to get the best model for  the data. Goal was to  construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per annum.

## Project 2:  Developing an AI application : Image classification
--------------------------------------------------------------
- In this project, I  trained  an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We will be building  a deep learning neural network using PyTorch to identify 102 different species of flowers. We will  load a pretrained model and use  transfer learning techniques for this project

## Project 3: Identify Customer Segments to focus marketing resources
--------------------------------------------------------------
 - Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
