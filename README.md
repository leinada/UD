# Udacity related projects
##### Details of Udacity the two semester datascience nanodegree program is available [here]( https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)


## Project 1: Finding Donors for CharityML
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Applied supervised learning techniques  to accurately model individual's income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results was further optimized to get the best model for  the data. Goal was to  construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per annum.

## Project 2:  Developing an AI application : Image classification
--------------------------------------------------------------
- In this project, I  trained  an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. We will be building  a deep learning neural network using PyTorch to identify 102 different species of flowers. We will  load a pretrained model and use  transfer learning techniques for this project

## Project 3: Identify Customer Segments to focus marketing resources
--------------------------------------------------------------
 - Applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.

## Project 4: Data Science Blog
--------------------------------------------------------------
- In this project, I analyzed the 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey data to understand more about data science field. This project was intended to help individuals considering new career as data scientists; to help them make informed decisions about their career choice. We would try to answer three real world questions using the CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining).

## Project 5: Disaster Response Pipeline 
--------------------------------------------------------------
This project creates an ETL and machine learning pipeline to categorize real messages that were sent during disaster events. The aim is to send the  message  directly to the appropriate aid agencies after the categorization. This project includes development of a  web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories which was built using a machine learning model.
