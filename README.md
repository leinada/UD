# Udacity related projects
##### Details of Udacity the datascience nanodegree program (two semester)  is [here]( https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025)

### Project:1 Identify Customer Segments to focus marketing resources
--------------------------------------------------------------

 - Apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns.
 - This project requires Python 3.x and NumPy,Pandas, matplotlib,scikit-learn, seaborn python libraries
- Notebook [here](https://github.com/leinada/UD/blob/master/customer_segments/Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb)
- Analysis includes,

  * preprocessing of the data.
  * handling of missing data.
  * feature selection and re-encoding.
  * engineering of mixed type features.
  * feature transormation.
  * Dimensionality Reduction via PCA.
  * KMeans clustering.
  * Comparison of customer data to demographics data.

### Project:2 Finding Donors for CharityML
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Apply supervised Learning techniques  to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. The best candidate algorithm from preliminary results is further optimized to get the best model for  the data. Goal is to  construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000 per annum.

- This project requires Python 3.x and NumPy,Pandas, matplotlib,scikit-learn and  seaborn python libraries

- Notebook [here](https://github.com/leinada/UD/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb)

- Analysis includes,

  * Exploratory analysis of the data.
  * Standardization of data
  * Evaluating Model Performance (RF, adaboost, SVM)
  * Hyper parameter tuning
  * Extraction  of important features

## Project:3  Developing an AI application : Image classification
--------------------------------------------------------------
 - This project requires Python 3.x and needas a GPU environment, running on CPU is hopeless
- In this project, we will train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers.
- Notebook [here](https://github.com/leinada/UD/blob/master/imageClassifierUsing_pytorch/ImageClassifierProject.ipynb)
- Analysis incudes
  * Loading and dataset using PyTorch
  * Use one of the pretrained models from torchvision.models, build and train the classifier viatransfer learning
  * Inference for classification
  * Class Prediction using the developed model
