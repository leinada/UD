# 2018 stack overflow survey data analysis

## Project motivation and details

This project contains an analysis of the data collected by Stack Overflow as part of their annual 2018 developer survey.

In this project we will try to understand more about data science field, with the help of data. This project is intended to help individuals considering new career as data scientists; to help them make informed decisions about their career choice. We would try to answer three real world questions using the CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining).

- What is the general profile of a data scientist?
- How is the typical employment, schedule and salaries look like?
- What type of technology is needed to break into this field?.
