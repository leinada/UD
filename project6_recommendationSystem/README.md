## Project 6: Recommendation System with IBM 
--------------------------------------------------------------
Recommendation engines are one of the most important data science applications. Data science is being used to recommend things such asmusic, movies , books, new destinations etc. In this project, I analysed the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles I think they will like. This project will serve as a prototype of the recommender systems of the article recommendation systems of IBM

- This project requires Python 3.x and NumPy,Pandas, matplotlib,scikit-learn  libraries

- Analysis includes,

  * Exploratory analysis of the data.
  * Rank Based Recommendations
  * User-User Based Collaborative Filtering
